I found this very interesting while going through the External Resource, the Open Class exercises, on Loops.

Specifically, I thought it was fascinating that you can write loops so many different ways to achieve the same effect.

See my notes on Problem 4 below:

Problem 4

Write a for loop that prints every third number from 0 up to, and including, 99.

for (let i = 0; i <= 99; i + 3) {
        console.log(i);
}

^^^^ That doesn't work, the immediately below does, but it can't be quite right, haha

for (let i = 0; i <= 99;) {
        console.log(i)
        i++, i++, i++;
}


oh, this is what they had in mind:

for (let i = 0; i <= 99;) {
        console.log(i)
        i = i + 3;
}

Or at least when I thought about it more (before I looked at their solution, I remembered that you have to assign i in the loop to i + 3.

The instructor's solution (Instructor Tyler Wilhelm) goes as follows:

for(var i = 0; i <= 99; i++){
        if(i % 3 === 0){
                console.log(i)
        }
}

At the bottom of the page, they have another verion and ask if it would give the same output. I answered no, but this was wrong.

var i = 0;
do {
        if (i % 3 === 0) {
                console.log(i);
        }
        i++;
}
while (i <= 99)

The answer is yes. But I find that first if statement confusing; if (i % 3 === 0).... ohhhhh. If i divided by 3 equals 0... Now it makes sense. Yeah, that should work. So many ways to get the same answer.
