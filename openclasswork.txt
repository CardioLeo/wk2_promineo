//Write your code here
switch (monthNumber) {
    case monthNumber=1:
        console.log("January");
        break;
    case monthNumber=2:
        console.log("February");

}

Problem 4

Write an IF statement that checks to see if there is enough money to cover the cost of a soda. If so, print "I can buy a soda!".
If not, print "I need to earn some more money!"

var fs = require("fs");
var input = fs.readFileSync(process.stdin.fd, "utf-8").trim().split("\n");
var money = parseInt(input[0]);
var costOfSoda = parseInt(input[1]);

//write your code here

if (costOfSoda > money) {
        console.log("I need to earn some more money!")
}
else {
if (costOfSoda <= money) {
        console.log("I can buy a soda!")
}
}

---

Problem 5

Write a series of IF/ELSE IF statements that check the numberGrade and assign letterGrade to a string of the corresponding letter grade. Print the letter grade to the console.

A: 90+
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: 0-59

Make sure to use a capital letter for the grade.

if (numberGrade >= 90) {
	console.log("A");
} else if (numberGrade >= 80 && numberGrade <= 89) {
	console.log("B");
}
else if (numberGrade >= 70 && numberGrade <= 79) {
	console.log("C");
}
else if (numberGrade >= 60 && numberGrade <= 69) {
	console.log("D");
}
else if (numberGrade <= 59) {
	console.log("F");
}

---

Problem 8(?)

Write an IF/ELSE statement that prints the smaller of the two given inputs, num1 and num2. If they are the same, print "same".

var fs = require("fs");
var input = fs.readFileSync(process.stdin.fd, "utf-8").trim().split("\n");
var num1 = parseInt(input[0]);
var num2 = parseInt(input[1]);

//write your code here

if (num1 == num2) {
        console.log("same");
} else if (num1 < num2) {
        console.log(num1);
} else if (num2 < num1) {
        console.log(num2);
}

---

Problem 9(?)

Create an if/else if statement that checks myNumber against num1 and based on which condition evaluates to true, print the following messages:

num1 + " is smaller than my number, " + myNumber num1 + " is larger than my number, " + myNumber num1 + " is equal to my number, " + myNumber

var fs = require("fs");
var input = fs.readFileSync(process.stdin.fd, "utf-8").trim().split("\n");
var myNumber = parseInt(input[0]);
var num1 = parseInt(input[1]);

//write your code here.

if (num1 == myNumber) {
	console.log(num1 + " is equal to my number, " + myNumber);
} else if (num1 > myNumber) {
	console.log(num1 + " is larger than my number, " + myNumber);
} else if (num1 < myNumber) {
	console.log(num1 + " is smaller than my number, " + myNumber);
}

---

Problem 10(?)

Write an IF statement that checks if the given age is greater than or equal to 16. If it is, set canDrive to true and print it's value to the console.

var fs = require("fs");
var input = fs.readFileSync(process.stdin.fd, "utf-8").trim().split("\n");
var age = parseInt(input[0]);
var canDrive = false;

//Write your code here

if (age >= 16) {
	canDrive = true;
	console.log(canDrive);
}

Loops 

---

Problem 1

Create a for loop that prints out a multiplication table for num from 1 through 10 as follows (the value of num will be input by the user):
If a user enters 1, the console should print the following:

1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 =2
1 x 3 = 3
1 x 4 = 4
1 x 5 = 5
1 x 6 = 6
1 x 7 = 7
1 x 8 = 8
1 x 9 = 9
1 x 10 = 10

for (let i = 1; i < 11; i++) {
        console.log(num + " x " + i + " = " + num * i);
}

---

Problem 2

Using the supplied variables, create a loop of your choice that will add cups of rice to a bowl. Each time a cup of rice is added, print "The bowl contains X cups of rice.", where X is the number of cups added. Once the number of cups called for has been reached, print "We have enough rice!".
Note, we don't need to know if the bowl is empty.

var fs = require("fs");
var input = fs.readFileSync(process.stdin.fd, "utf-8").trim().split("\n");

var requiredCupsOfRice = parseInt(input[0]);
var currentCupsOfRice = 0;

//write your code here

while (currentCupsOfRice < requiredCupsOfRice) {
	console.log("The bowl contains " + currentCupsOfRice + " cups of rice.");
	currentCupsOfRice++;
	if (currentCupsOfRice == requiredCupsOfRice) break;
	console.log("We have enough rice!"):
}

XXXXX

That doesn't work;

try this:

currentCupsOfRice++;
do {console.log("The bowl contains " + currentCupsOfRice + " cups of rice.") + currentCupsOfRice++} while (currentCupsOfRice <= requiredCupsOfRice);

console.log("We have enough rice!");

---

Problem 3

Write a for loop that prints the numbers 0 to x. The x has been initialized for you and will be based on a user's input.

var fs = require("fs");
var input = fs.readFileSync(process.stdin.fd, "utf-8").trim().split("\n");
var x = parseInt(input[0]);


//write your code here

for (let i = 0; i <= x; i++) {
	console.log(i);
}

---

Problem 4

Write a for loop that prints every third number from 0 up to, and including, 99.

for (let i = 0; i <= 99; i + 3) {
	console.log(i);
}

^^^^ That doesn't work, the immediately below does, but it can't be quite right, haha

for (let i = 0; i <= 99;) {
        console.log(i)
        i++, i++, i++;
}


oh, this is what they had in mind:

for (let i = 0; i <= 99;) {
        console.log(i)
        i = i + 3;
}

Or at least when I thought about it more (before I looked at their solution, I remembered that you have to assign i in the loop to i + 3.

The instructor's solution (Instructor Tyler Wilhelm) goes as follows:

for(var i = 0; i <= 99; i++){
	if(i % 3 === 0){
		console.log(i)
	}
}

At the bottom of the page, they have another verion and ask if it would give the same output. I answered no, but this was wrong.

var i = 0;
do {
	if (i % 3 === 0) {
		console.log(i);
	}
	i++;
}
while (i <= 99)

The answer is yes. But I find that first if statement confusing; if (i % 3 === 0).... ohhhhh. If i divided by 3 equals 0... Now it makes sense. Yeah, that should work. So many ways to get the same answer.

Problem 5

Let's play a game. The game will consist of 100 turns. If the number of turns is even, you gain 5 points. If it's odd, you gain 3 points. If ever your score is equal to 125, you are reset back to 25 points. This will only be allowed to happen once. The game ends if you are able to make it through 100 turns or you reach more than 290 points, whichever comes first.

Using a for loop, create the game.

var points = 0;
var pointsReset = false; 

//write your code here

First attempt:

if (pointsReset = true) {
	points = 25;
}

while (points != 125) do {
	if (points = 125) {
		pointsReset = true;
}

for (let turns = 0; turns === 100; turns++) {
	if (turns % 2 === 0) {
		points = points + 5;
	}
	if (turns % 2 === 1) {
		points = points + 3;
	}
                console.log("The points are: " + points + 
" and the turns are " + turns);
}
